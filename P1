	<p>He was carrying a basket full of red caps on his head and going through a forest. As it was a hot day, he got tired in the heat of the sun and thought of taking rest for a while.</p>

	<p>Suddenly when the cap seller woke up, he was shocked to see his basket empty. He searched for his caps everywhere. But, to his surprise, he saw the monkeys on the tree were wearing them.</p>
